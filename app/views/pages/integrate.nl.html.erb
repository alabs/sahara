<p>Your website can actively participate: be a part of the net of blogs and
websites that ask for sending emails to stop the massacre that is being
held in the Sahara.</p>

<p>If you want to embed this form into your website, just create a new
entry in your blog (Wordpress, Drupal, SPIP or any other) explaining the
campaign. Then copy the following 
<a href="/resources/htmlformen.txt">HTML code</a> in this new entry (take into
account that you might need to enable "full html" code). It is important
to ask for politeness and clarity in their messages (they are sent from
the user's own email address) in order to increase their effectiveness.
Please keep your blog entry visible during the lenght of the campaign.</p>
